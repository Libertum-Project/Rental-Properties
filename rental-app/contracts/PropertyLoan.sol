contract PropertyLoan is ERC20 {

    /*
    SUMMARY OF THIS CONTRACT:
        -factoryContract is the one that deploys this(Property) contract
        -constructor create the collection and set the bank & factory contract
        -all the purchases will be done in usdt for practical purposes
        -buyPiece is the only function that the users can call 
        -transfer will be DISABLED when the investmentType is a LOAN
        -when all the NFTs(pieces) are sold out, this contract will register itself in the bank
        -only when the collection is sold out, the s_receiver will get all the funds from this contract
    
    TO DO(for now): 
        1. change all state variables to private and create external functions to view them
        2. implement buyPiece function
        3. transfer funds once collection is sold out
        4. create a function for the users to get their funds back if the collection wasn't sold out in 1 month
        5. disable transfers for this collection
        6. at the end, try to optimize some lines of code.
